          <p>Menzies Search has a simple philosophy: It's all 
          about comfort. By listening to my clients and getting to 
          know my candidates, I'm able to make matches that fit perfectly 
          - and are mutually beneficial to both parties.</p>
          <p>Since starting this business, I've found the best candidates are discovered 
          by taking the time to learn about their career goals, aspirations 
          and dreams. I uncover what they loved about their last job, 
          and what they didn't. I assess their skills objectively. 
          And I keep in touch regularly. </p>
          <p>That same philosophy applies to my clients. By listening 
          intently and talking openly, I'm able to truly assess not 
          just the assignment, but the environment as well. That way, 
          I'm able to deliver the candidates best suited to fit both 
          short and long-term needs. </p>
          <p>I pride myself on keeping everyone's best interests at 
          heart, and building bonds and relationships that grow stronger 
          through the years. Maybe that's why clients and candidates 
          are comfortable enough to stay in touch with me long after 
          an assignment is over.<br>

          <div><p><h9><img src = "pix/donna_menzies.jpg" style="border:15px solid transparent"><br>Hi. I'm Donna Menzies. I specialize in recruiting and placing 
          advertising and marketing communication professionals. </p>
          <p>I started Menzies Search in 2000.  Prior to becoming an executive recruiter, I spent 15 years 
          in account management at nationally known agencies like 
          Campbell Mithun, Carlson Marketing Group and Rapp Collins 
          Worldwide. That experience taught me firsthand the skills 
          needed to excel in the communications field &#8212; and 
          how to spot those skills in individuals.</p>
          <p>Today I use that part-knowledge-part-intuition to help 
          people find new opportunities, and help companies find employees 
          that exceed their expectations. My knack for staying on 
          top of the business, and my insider's knowledge on who's 
          good at what and who's ready to make a change, make me uniquely 
          qualified to match personnel to position &#8212; and make 
          my clients' lives a lot easier.</p>
          <p>So whether your company is located in Minneapolis, or you're 
          looking to hire from one of the strongest advertising communities 
          in the country, let me do the legwork in finding the perfect 
          fit for your organization.</h9></p></div>

          <h4>Problem&#8230;</h4>
          <p>A large national promotions agency needed a Mac Production 
          Supervisor to replace someone who was relocating to a branch 
          office. </p>
          <h4>Solved</h4>
          <p>They were so happy with my candidate (and my process) that 
          they've used me to help them with four other searches to 
          date: Creative Director, Associate Creative Director, Sr. 
          Art Director, and Jr. Art Director.</p>
          <h4>_________________ </h4>
          <h4>Problem&#8230;</h4>
          <p>A non-profit corporation wanted to bring their agency services 
          in-house so they could better manage their media dollars.</p>
          <h4>Solved</h4>
          <p>After being referred to them by the same agency they let 
          go, I helped them find a Media Planner and Assistant Media 
          Buyer to round out their team.</p>
          <h4>_________________ </h4>
          <h4>Problem&#8230;</h4>
          <p>A national retailer hired me to fill a management position 
          in their in-house agency that had been open for about a 
          year. The strict requirements of this position narrowed 
          the pool of candidates significantly.</p>
          <h4>Solved</h4>
          <p>My candidate met all of their requirements -- education, 
          experience and salary. He was the first candidate I brought 
          them. </p>
          <h4>_________________ </h4>
          <h4>Problem&#8230;</h4>
          <p>A small design firm wanted an Account Supervisor who wasn't 
          shy about making new business contacts. </p>
          <h4>Solved</h4>
          <p>I delivered a candidate who had spent time as a partner 
          in a small design firm, where she handled both new business 
          and account service responsibilities. The client appreciated 
          having an employee who understood the challenges of running 
          a business. And the candidate was thrilled to have more 
          than one co-worker again!</p>

          <h4>Problem&#8230;</h4>
          <p>A national full-service ad agency had grown their B2B public 
          relations accounts and needed the talents of an experienced 
          public relations Account Supervisor.</p>
          <h4>Solved</h4>
          <p>I delivered the one and only candidate they ever had to 
          interview.</p>
          <h4>_________________ </h4>
          <h4>Problem&#8230;</h4>
          <p>A design firm where I had placed a designer and account 
          executive was trying to fill an office manager/receptionist 
          position. After interviewing candidates another search firm 
          (who specializes in Admin but not Agencies) had supplied, 
          the owner wanted to see if I could help them. </p>
          <h4>Solved</h4>
          <p>Within a week they interviewed three candidates and brought 
          two back for second interviews. Their new office manager/receptionist 
          was hired within two weeks of calling Menzies Search.</p>
          <h4>_________________ </h4>
          <h4>Problem&#8230;</h4>
          <p>An interactive agency called after being frustrated with 
          another search firm's efforts to find them an HR Director. 
          The candidates they brought them were all too junior and 
          had no previous agency experience. </p>
          <h4>Solved</h4>
          <p>Within a few weeks I brought them four candidates, three 
          of whom they invited back for a second interview.

          <p>Communication is key at Menzies Search.</p>
          <p>That's why I invite dialogue throughout the process. Finding 
          you the right person happens only when I have a clear understanding 
          of your specific business situation and needs. Of course, 
          anything you share will be kept confidential. </p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Provide as much search information as you can.</strong> 
              A job description along with specific details related 
              to salary, reporting structure and compensation help both 
              of us define and determine the job search. </li>
              <li><strong>Approach every candidate I offer with respect 
              and honesty.</strong> Resumes and interviews should be 
              handled in a way that encourages -not discourages, job 
              procurement. Keep in mind your treatment of candidates 
              during the hiring process is what stays with them.</li>
              <li><strong>Provide feedback. </strong>If you think someone 
              is great, let me know. Or, if I've missed the mark, an 
              honest conversation will help get the search back on track.</li>
              <li><strong>Tell me if a search is cancelled or put on hold.</strong> 
              If the status of a search changes, it's important I know 
              as soon as possible. </li>
              <li><strong>Be realistic about your timing.</strong> Each 
              search is different and can be time-consuming. Finding 
              three qualified candidates can often take weeks or months. 
              But, the time I spend is time you save.</li>

          <h3><font color="045FB4"><b>Maximizing the recruiter relationship</b></font></h3>
          <p>If you're looking for a full-time job, working with a good 
          executive recruiter should be a part of your job search 
          efforts. Recruiters are connected, informed, and don't cost 
          you a thing. </p>
          <p>But regardless of which recruiter you end up working with, 
          there are several things you should know to maximize the 
          relationship &#8212; and increase the potential for placement. 
          </p>
          <h4>They aren't your personal job search bot</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Recruiters work for their client (the agency or company), 
              not you (the candidate). That's why they don't cost you 
              a thing. </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>You are their most valuable asset</h4>
              <ul>
                <li> Good recruiters are only as good as the candidates 
                in their database. So trust that if your skills and experience 
                fit a search they're conducting, they'll definitely give 
                you a call.</li>
              </ul>
            <h4>They get paid when you get hired</h4>
              <ul>
                <li> Most independent recruiters are &quot;contingent&quot;, 
                which means they are paid only if they make a placement. 
                They are paid a percentage based on the candidate's negotiated 
                starting salary. </li>
                <li>Large recruiting firms usually work on &quot;retainer&quot;, 
                which means they get paid throughout the recruiting process 
                whether they are successful or not.</li>
                <li>A recruiter's payment does not affect or come out of 
                your salary.</li>
              </ul>
            <h4>Not all recruiters are created equal </h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Ask colleagues and networking contacts for referrals 
                to good recruiters. </li>
                <li>Consider recruiters that specialize in your area of 
                expertise or desired geographic location.</li>
              </ul>
            <h4>Meet, greet and grill</h4>
              <ul>
                <li> Try to meet with the recruiter in person to find out 
                how they operate.</li>
                <li> Find out the types of clients they've worked with, 
                and the types of candidates they've placed.</li>
                <li> Decide if you want to work with them. If so, give them 
                &quot;permission&quot; to keep your resume on file.</li>
              </ul>
            <h4>You control your resume</h4>
              <ul>
                <li> A reputable recruiter will always discuss an opportunity 
                with you prior to presenting your resume to a potential 
                employer.</li>
              </ul>
            <h4>Honesty is the best policy</h4>
              <ul>
                <li> Once you've decided to work with a recruiter, be candid 
                about your salary and position requirements. They can't 
                present you unless they know what you're looking for.</li>
                <li> If they send you on an interview, contact them afterwards 
                to discuss your interest and provide feedback on how it 
                went.</li>
                <li> If you've already approached a client company yourself 
                or through a networking source (and your resume is on 
                file with them), tell your recruiter. </li>
              </ul>
            <h4>Keep in touch. Just keep it to a minimum</h4>
              <ul>
                <li> Develop a relationship with a recruiter by keeping 
                them up to date on your career.</li>
                <li> If you've accepted a new job or received a promotion, 
                send your recruiter an updated resume to ensure their 
                database stays current.</li>
                <li> Recruiters use their database to contact candidates 
                that match their client's job specifications - and sometimes, 
                the best career opportunities come when you aren't looking. 
                (Client companies use recruiters to source candidates 
                who aren't necessarily job hunting.) So provide recruiters 
                with updated contact information (phone, address, e-mail). 
                If we can't get in touch with you, your perfect job may 
                never be presented to you.</li>
                <li> Don't follow up with a recruiter excessively &#8212; 
                unless you are in the process of interviewing with one 
                of their clients. </li>
              </ul>

			<h3><font color="045FB4"><b>You are what you show</b></font></h3>
            <p>In this business, your eyes aren't the window to your soul, 
            your portfolio is. It's also the door to a world of opportunity. 
            That's why it's crucial to give your portfolio the same 
            attention to detail that you would any creative challenge. 
            </p>
            <h3>Tips for putting together a strong portfolio</h3>
            <h4>First things first</h4>
            <p>Your resume is your first portfolio piece and must make 
            a good impression. Your choice of typography, layout, information, 
            even paper stock, contribute to what that impression will 
            be. Don't underestimate or short-shrift this important piece 
            of paper.</p>
            <h4>Put your best piece forward </h4>
            <p>Your opening sample should be your best, most provoking 
            piece &#8212; a springboard into conversation about your 
            work. Leave your next best piece for last, to leave a lasting 
            impression. </p>
            <h4>8 is the loneliest number</h4>
            <p>Somewhere between 10 and 20 samples is best. Too many pieces 
            can send mixed signals, as it will invariably be padded 
            with weaker pieces. Make sure you have enough to demonstrate 
            the breadth and depth of your abilities. Still, less is 
            more if all the pieces are strong. Quantity is not a substitute 
            for quality.</p>
            <h4>Good work speaks for itself</h4>
            <p>Your work should demonstrate your ability to think strategically. 
            Use stronger pieces as opportunities to talk about your 
            strategic thinking or any special skills you used to execute 
            the project. Your samples should communicate that you can 
            execute on that strategy.</p>
            <h4>Think paper dolls</h4>
            <p>Create a portfolio that gives you the flexibility to add 
            and subtract work easily: one that fits a common format. 
            This will give you the ability to customize your portfolio 
            for each interview. The creative samples you take to the 
            interview should match the position you are interviewing 
            for. </p>
            <h4>Cleanliness counts</h4>
            <p>Always make sure your samples are clean. You will be showing 
            your pieces to people who recognize and appreciate high 
            quality work. Don't put yourself in the position of having 
            to apologize for materials that are damaged. </p>
            <h4>Think body double</h4>
            <p>Create a portfolio that can speak for itself. You may not 
            always have the luxury of being present when it's viewed. 
            So consider adding a brief paragraph for each piece with 
            a statement of the challenge and how you solved it. </p>
            <h4>Remember your manners</h4>
            <p>A thank you note that reflects your personality or the 
            design of your resume is not only polite; it's another opportunity 
            to market yourself. Create a leave-behind piece that showcases 
            your strongest pieces. Use a format that will fit in a file 
            drawer, if possible. The interviewer may be looking to hire 
            someone in the future, and you want to be within his or 
            her reach.
